# Explanation of Relationship Between "Product" and "Product_Category" Entities

## Nature of Relationship:
The relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is one of association, where each product is categorized into one specific product category. This relationship allows for the organization and classification of products based on shared characteristics or attributes.

## One-to-Many Relationship:
Typically, there exists a one-to-many relationship between "Product_Category" and "Product". This means that each product category can have multiple products associated with it, but each product can only belong to one category at a time.

# Ensuring Valid Category Assignment for Each Product in the "Product" Table

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, the following strategies can be employed:

**Ensuring each product has a valid category:**
- To maintain data integrity and enforce referential integrity constraints, it's essential to set up a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. This ensures that every product record in the "Product" table must have a corresponding valid category in the "Product_Category" table. Additionally, implementing data validation checks at the application level or utilizing database triggers can prevent the insertion or updating of product records without a valid category assignment, thus ensuring the integrity of the data.

1. **Utilize Foreign Key Constraints**:
   - Define a foreign key relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" tables. This enforces referential integrity, ensuring that every value in the `category_id` column of the "Product" table corresponds to a valid primary key value in the `category_id` column of the "Product_Category" table.

2. **Implement Data Validation Rules**:
   - Incorporate data validation rules within the application logic. Before inserting or updating a product record in the "Product" table, validate that the associated category exists in the "Product_Category" table. If the category does not exist, prevent the operation or prompt the user to select a valid category.

These measures ensure that the integrity of the database is maintained, and each product is properly categorized according to the defined schema.
